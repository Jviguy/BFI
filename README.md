# BFI
A simple C brainfuck interpreter that I used an example to make (im new to C lmao)
## Usage
### Windows
Download the binary from the releases section. Once installed just simple go to your CLI and run BFI.exe example.bf and you should see the brainfuck code be ran.
### Posix
Download the source code (git clone https://github.com/Jviguy/BFI.git) and build it yourself as I don't have linux compatible gcc on my local device sorry.
